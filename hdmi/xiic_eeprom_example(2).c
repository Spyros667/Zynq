/**
* @file xiic_eeprom_example.c
*
* This file consists of a Interrupt mode design example which uses the Xilinx
* IIC device and XIic driver to exercise the EEPROM. The XIic driver uses the
* complete FIFO functionality to transmit/receive data.
*
* This example writes/reads from the lower 256 bytes of the IIC EEPROMS. Please
* refer to the datasheets of the IIC EEPROM's for details about the internal
* addressing and page size of these devices.
*
* The XIic_MasterSend() API is used to transmit the data and
* XIic_MasterRecv() API is used to receive the data.
*
* This example is tested on ML300/ML310/ML410/ML403/ML501/ML507/ML510/ML605/
* SP601, SP605, KC705 , ZC702 and ZC706  Xilinx boards.
*
* The ML310/ML510/ML410 boards have a on-board 64 Kb serial IIC EEPROM
* (Microchip 24LC64A). The WP pin of the IIC EEPROM is hardwired to ground on
* this board.
*
* The ML300 board has an on-board 32 Kb serial IIC EEPROM(Microchip 24LC32A).
* The WP pin of the IIC EEPROM has to be connected to ground for this example.
* The WP is connected to pin Y3 of the FPGA.
*
* The ML403 board has an on-board 4 Kb serial IIC EEPROM(Microchip 24LC04A).
* The WP pin of the IIC EEPROM is hardwired to ground on this board.
*
* The ML501/ML505/ML507/ML605/SP601/SP605/KC705/ZC702/ZC706 boards have an
* on-board 8 Kb serial IIC EEPROM(STM M24C08). The WP pin of the IIC EEPROM is
* hardwired to ground on these boards.
*
* The AddressType for ML300/ML310/ML410/ML510 boards should be u16 as the
* address pointer in the on board EEPROM is 2 bytes.
*
* The AddressType for ML403/ML501/ML505/ML507/ML605/SP601/SP605/KC705/ZC702/
* ZC706 boards should be u8 as the address pointer for the on board EEPROM
* is 1 byte.
*
* The 7 bit IIC Slave address of the IIC EEPROM on the ML300/ML310/ML403/ML410/
* ML501/ML505/ML507/ML510 boards is 0x50.
* The 7 bit IIC Slave address of the IIC EEPROM on the ML605/SP601/SP605/KC705
* /ZC702/ZC706 boards is 0x54.
* Refer to the User Guide's of the respective boards for further information
* about the IIC slave address of IIC EEPROM's.
*
* The define EEPROM_ADDRESS in this file needs to be changed depending on
* the board on which this example is to be run. This is the IIC address of the
* EEPROM.
*
* The define IIC_MUX_ADDRESS in this file needs to be changed depending on
* the board on which this example is to be run. This is the IIC address of the
* the MUX.
*
* The define IIC_MUX_ENABLE should be defined so that the IIC Mux initialization
* is done for the boards on the which the EEPROM is connected to an IIC Mux.
* The boards with a MUX are a KC705/ZC702/ZC706.
*
* The define IIC_EEPROM_CHANNEL needs to be changed depending on the Channel
* number of EEPROM for IIC Mux. On KC705 it is 0x08 and ZC702 is 0x04. Please
* refer the User Guide's of the respective boards for further information
* about the Channel number to use EEPROM.
*
* This code assumes that no Operating System is being used.
